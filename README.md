# Age-Gender-estimation
Age estimation is the determination of a person’s age based on biometric features. Although age estimation can be accomplished using different biometric traits, our work is focused on facial age estimation that relies on biometric features extracted from a person’s face.   In the area of computerized analysis of facial images for recognition, ethnicity classification, gender recognition, etc. the age estimation is a barely explored part. However recently the interest in this subject has significantly increased, due to its practical applications. For example there are age limitations for driving a car, buying alcohol, cigarettes, films, video games, etc. which should be obeyed, but the human skills of age estimation are very limited. So a computer system, which supports the responsible persons, would be helpful. It is well known that the human-computer interaction varies for different age groups, thus a system which automatically adapts its interface to the age of the current user would clear this problem. Face detection: To detect whether an image represent a face i.e. the general structure of face or not. General structure include forehead, eyes, nose, lips, chin etc.
